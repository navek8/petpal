          <p>We know that your pet is one of the most important parts of your life and we want to celebrate that unique relationship to its fullest. From the research you do before adopting or owning your pet, to the first day you take them home with you, to the true companionship you build, through the happy and challenging (potty-training) times you've shared with your pet, PetPal wants to help you along with the journey.</p>
          <p>By offering a platform for pet owners to connect with each other, we hope to provide not only informational resources but also a strong community for both pets and animal lovers to meet and come together. PetPal is a place for us to share personal pet stories, photos, product reviews, animal friendly trails and parks, and veterinarian health advice. It also can help us in the most trying situations-when our pets go missing-through the Amber Alert system and hardware.</p>
          <p>We will launch our first product version in Q1 2016, initially focusing on Dog owners. As we grow, we will expand our PetPal community to Cats, Horses, and other animals. Please join us as we build our pet and animal enthusiast network around the world!</p>
